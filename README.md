# nba_ai_awards
 
 This Machine Learning project aims to follow and predict the end-of-season awards of the NBA. A model was developed for each award and they are ran each week to produce a live ranking. All results are published on Instagram weekly: https://www.instagram.com/nba.ai_/
 
 The repository includes notebooks used to scrape the data using BeautifulSoup from Basketball Reference (https://www.basketball-reference.com), clean and prepare the data, test ML models, visualise the results as well as the scripts which are ran every week.
